          Hello! I am Aarya Pathak, a second year Computer Science student at Kathmandu University with a strong interest in Cognitive Science. My academic interest bridges the gap between computing and human cognition which allows me to solve problems from a unique perspective.

          After my graduation, I don't see myself preparing to get into MAANG or hold any other positions expected from a pure CS graduate. I see myself going deeper into the field of cognitive science and understanding more about human cognition, which I believe is fundamental to machine cognition. These are some of my research questions which I would love to research about and turn the gained knowledge to build a startup. How does attention work? How could we solve mental health conditions using computation and cognitive science? How does our brain perceive information and if we could make it to believe another way? You can add all your sci-fi thoughts regarding the human brain and that's a research question right there. So cool.

          Apart from science and coding, I like to spend most of my time either playing cricket, cycling, reading books or thinking about any 3 of them. I have a very active social life in college as well which helps me engage and interact in conversation of wide different topics. I actually enjoy most of them but sometimes I would just nod my head to get me out of the situation.

          I always look forward to creating meaningful connections and creating impact in any way possible. If you are interested to know more about me or talk about ideas which have potential to create an impact of any sort, we can definitely have a coffee together. You can contact me via the contact form in the contact section or through my socials which are presented in the footer. Thank you! Looking forward.
