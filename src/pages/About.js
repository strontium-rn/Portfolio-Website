      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Aarya Pathak, a second-year Computer Science student at Kathmandu University with a strong interest in Cognitive Science. My academic interest bridges the gap between computing and understanding human cognition, which allows me to approach problems from unique perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that technology should enhance our human experience, and I'm particularly fascinated by how we can develop systems that better understand and interact with humans. This interdisciplinary approach guides my learning and research work.

      <p>
        Apart from science and coding. I like to spend most of my time either playing cricket, cycling, reading books or thinking about any 3 of them. I have a very active social life in college as well which helps me enagage and interact in conversation of wide different topics. I actually enjoy most of them but sometimes I would just nod my head to get me out of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always look forward to creating meaningful connections and creating impact in any way possible. If you are interested to know more about me or talk about ideas which has potential to create impace of any sort, we can definitely schedule our meeting. You can contact me via the contact form in the contact section or through my socials which are presented in the footer. Thank you! Looking forward.
